# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

<div>
  <p>Hello! I'm Daniyal Rouhbakhsh, a Backend Developer focused on Node.js and passionate about working with data.

ðŸ’¼ Background? Before starting my journey in programming, I worked in digital marketing, designing ad campaigns with Google Ads. But my true interest has always been in data â€“ turning raw information into valuable insights for businesses.

ðŸ’¡ My Goal? I want to combine my skills in databases and backend development with my knowledge in Business Intelligence (BI) to help make businesses smarter.

ðŸŒŸ In short: Iâ€™m a backend developer who loves data.

And finally, a quote I believe in:
"In God we trust, all others must bring data."</p>
